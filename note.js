// Node.js is a javascript runtime built on google's open-source v8 javascript engine
// Javascript runtime is like a container or an environment where code written in Js can be run
/**
 * Nodejs pros:
 * Single-threaded, based on event driven, non-blockin I/O model
 * Perfect for building FASt and SCALLABLE data-intensive app
 * 
 * Use of Node.js
 * API with database behind it (prefarably NoSQL)
 * Data Streaming (like YoiTube and Netflix)
 * Real-time chat application
 * Server-side web applications 
 * 
 * DONT USE:
 * Dont use with applications the need heavy server-side processing (CPU-intensive), heavy video compressions, image manipulations

//Todo: synchronous vs asynchronous
// Synchronous => Blocking
// Asynchronous => Non-blocking
// I/O => Input, Output

//? Node is built around call backs to achieve an asynchronous behaviour
